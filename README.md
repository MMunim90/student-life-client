I consider home page as a unique feature because, In the Home page, students or users can see posts from others. Posts are divided into categories: **Blog, Education, Achievement, and Job**.

* **Education**: All academic and skill-related posts belong here.

* **Achievement**: Students can share their personal or academic achievements.

* **Job**: Recruiters can create detailed job posts, which helps students who want to earn money to cover their expenses. Students can also create job posts with their full bio to seek opportunities.

* **Blog**: For all other student life–related posts.
